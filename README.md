# Lending-Club-Predict-Model
A dataset containing complete
loan data for all loans issued through the platform over the period from 2007 to the present is available
on their website:

In this project, I build my own models using a peer-to-peer lending dataset, and test the predictive ability of a few different Machine Learning algorithms
